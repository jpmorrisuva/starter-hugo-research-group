The current and likely future focus of my laboratory is concerned with social brain development in preschool children. As children transition from preschool to school-age, they begin to acquire the ability to better understand the thoughts, intentions and actions of others and to experience complex social emotions. These social capabilities are predicated on the maturation of neural systems that are in-turn shaped by biological and environment factors. This developmental period is not only crucial for fostering and maintaining close social relationships, but is also associated with development of cognitive skills and overall school-readiness. My work with OXTRm and innovations in data analytics make this the ideal time to investigate social brain development in children. With funding from the UVa Brain Institute, we have collected a small longitudinal sample of preschool children and have generated promising preliminary results. I currently have two major grant proposals under review and expect these projects to be the primary focus of the lab for the next 5-10 years.

My lab has been federally funded since its inception in 2009. It will be noted that I have not received R01 funding from the NIH to support any of our projects, but instead we have relied on grants from the NSF. I wish to provide context to my record as it may otherwise be perceived to be a weakness. When I began as an independent investigator I was supported by an R00 Pathways to Independence grant from NIMH. As I completed the work in that grant, NIMH shifted focus from many of the cognitive neuroscience initiatives they had previously supported in favor of an RDoC framework that placed more emphasis on translational concepts. Moreover, grants focusing on specific genes involved in behavior were given lower preference in the RDoC framework. However, our recent shift to study developmental processes is directly in-line with funding priorities of NICDH, which is apparent given their enthusiasm for my prior student’s NRSA. I will also note that in the newly released NIH strategic plan, “Social Epigenomics” is listed as a key area of investment. This is an area that I have already made major contributions and one in which my lab continues to pursue new projects and collaborations. We currently have two R01 applications under review at NIH.
